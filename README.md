# Home_SalesHome Sales Analysis with PySpark
Project Overview
The Home_Sales project is a comprehensive analysis of home sales data using PySpark, a powerful tool for handling big data processing and analysis. This project demonstrates the capability of PySpark in processing large datasets, performing complex SQL queries, and optimizing query performance through caching and partitioning strategies.

Key Features
Data Processing with PySpark: The project begins with reading home sales data into a Spark DataFrame, showcasing the ease and efficiency of handling large datasets with PySpark.
SQL Query Analysis: Leveraging SparkSQL, a series of queries are performed to extract meaningful insights from the data. This includes calculating average prices of homes based on various criteria such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, and home size.
Caching for Performance Optimization: The project illustrates how to cache a DataFrame in Spark to optimize the performance of SQL queries.
Data Partitioning: Demonstrates partitioning the data by a specific field (date_built) to improve query performance and manage the dataset efficiently.
Performance Comparison: By comparing the runtime of queries with and without caching, as well as before and after partitioning, the project highlights the impact of these techniques on query performance.
